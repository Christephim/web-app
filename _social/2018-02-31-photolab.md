description: "When the National Gallery of Canada began collecting photography in 1967, few museums viewed the medium as fine art. Thanks to the passion and dedication of early supporters, a comprehensive collection has taken shape over the past fifty years. This exhibition celebrates the collectionâ€™s diversity, juxtaposing works made more than a century apart and creating new synergies, while also reflecting upon the human impulse to capture the seen and unseen worlds."
