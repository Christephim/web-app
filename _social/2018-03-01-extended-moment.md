description: "The Palast Orchester was founded in 1986 by Max Raabe and a group of fellow music students in order to play music from the period of Germany’s Golden Twenties. In 2017, Max Raabe and Palast Orchester began their “Let’s Do It” tour, featuring standard like the title song, “Music Maestro,” and “Stormy Weather.” The ensemble takes a unique approach to interpreting the original arrangements of many familiar melodies from American popular music to German classics. Enjoy of evening of vintage music and entertainment by this German phenomenon!"
