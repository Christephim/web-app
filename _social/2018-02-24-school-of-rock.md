description: "Based on the hit film, SCHOOL OF ROCK follows Dewey Finn, a failed, wannabe rock star, who decides to earn a few extra bucks by posing as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. There he turns a class of straight-A students into a guitar-shredding, bass-slapping, mind-blowing rock band."
