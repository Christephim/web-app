description: "Frontera brings together eight contemporary photographers’ views of a highly topical subject: the border separating Mexico and the United States. Made between 1997 and 2017, the works question the very notion of borders, attempt to define their edges, and explore their representation. Images by Mexicans Pablo López Luz and Alejandro Cartagena dialogue with works by Canadians Mark Ruwedel and Geoffrey James, Swiss Adrien Missika, American Kirsten Luce and German Daniel Schwarz."
