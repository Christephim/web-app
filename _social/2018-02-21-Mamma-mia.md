description: "Based on the legendary songs of ABBA, this sunny and funny tale unfolds on a Greek island paradise. Sophie dreams of a perfect wedding with her father giving her away. The only problem? She doesn't know who he is! Sneaking a peek in her mother’s old diaries, she discovers three possible fathers: Sam, Bill, and Harry. She secretly invites all three to the wedding, convinced that she’ll know her father when she sees him. On the eve of her wedding, her quest to discover the identity of her father brings all three men from her mother’s past back to the island they last visited 20 years ago. But when all three turn up, it may not be as clear as she thought"
