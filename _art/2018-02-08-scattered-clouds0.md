description: "Scattered Clouds is the sound of post apocalyptic romanticism. The Hull, Qu√©bec experimental out fit underscores auto-fictional narratives with brooding rhythm, cavernous vocals, and precise noise. Terse retro- synthetic soundscapes call to mind the works of Vangelis or Tangerine Dream, paired with the uneasy ecstasy of Suicide or the tense, thundering underbelly of SUUNS. A stand-out on the talent-deep Ottawa-Gatineau landscape, Scattered Clouds' sophomore album is due fall 2018 on Boiled Records."
